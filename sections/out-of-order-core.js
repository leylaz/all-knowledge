<p>An out-of-order core spends a large share of its area and power on rename, the issue queue, the ROB, and the LSQ. That spending pays off on some code and buys almost nothing on other code. Knowing which is which is most of what it takes to predict how a core change will move IPC.</p>
<h3 id="sec-what">What Dynamic Scheduling Buys</h3>
<p>The core executes in dataflow order: an instruction issues when its operands are ready, not when its turn comes in program order (Hennessy &amp; Patterson, Ch. 3, Tomasulo's algorithm and hardware speculation). A compiler can reorder instructions too, but only using what it knows at compile time. Dynamic scheduling helps exactly where run-time behavior differs from what the compiler could predict.</p>
<h3 id="sec-pays">Where It Pays Off</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unpredictable latency:</strong> a load can hit L1 in about 5 cycles or go to DRAM in 400+. On an in-order core, the first instruction that uses a missing load stalls everything behind it, so misses are serviced one at a time. An out-of-order core keeps going, reaches later independent loads, and overlaps their misses. This <strong>memory-level parallelism</strong> is the largest single source of out-of-order speedup.</li>
<li><strong>Renaming past the architectural registers:</strong> physical registers remove WAR and WAW hazards, so the hardware effectively unrolls loops further than the compiler can with 16 or 32 architectural registers (see <a href="#/renaming">Register Renaming</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Speculation across branches:</strong> with good prediction, the window spans many basic blocks. Static schedulers can only move work across branches with trace or superblock scheduling plus fix-up code.</li>
<li><strong>Run-time memory disambiguation:</strong> a compiler must assume that a store might alias a later load. The core lets the load go early and checks afterwards (see <a href="#/mdp">Memory Dependence Prediction</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong> one binary runs well across microarchitectures with different latencies and port counts, without being rescheduled for each.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec-little">Where It Buys Little</h3>
<p>A <strong>loop-carried chain</strong> is a dependence that crosses iterations: a value one iteration writes and the next iteration reads, such as the accumulator in <code>s += a[i]</code> or the pointer in <code>p = p-&gt;next</code>. Follow that value through every iteration and you get one chain, and each link can start only after the previous one finishes. Its latency per iteration is the sum of the latencies on that path, and that sum is a floor on time per iteration no matter how wide the core or how large the window. Register renaming doesn't break it, because renaming removes only false (WAR, WAW) dependences, and this one is true (RAW). Values that each iteration recomputes from scratch, such as a freshly loaded <code>a[i]</code>, aren't on the chain; they can run ahead. For example, with a 3-cycle FP add (Zen 3), <code>s += a[i]</code> takes at least 3 cycles per element even though the core has 2 FP add pipes. Keeping both pipes busy needs 3 × 2 = 6 adds in flight, so 6 independent partial sums.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A single dependence chain:</strong> pointer chasing, a loop-carried sum into one accumulator, a hash computed byte by byte. The chain's latency is the floor for every core, and there's nothing independent to pull forward.</li>
<li><strong>Compiler-scheduled compute kernels on L1-resident data:</strong> latencies are fixed and known, so the compiler can unroll and interleave independent work in program order. An in-order core then issues without stalls and both cores hit the same port-throughput ceiling (see <a href="#/comp-opt/static-sched">Static Scheduling and Compute Kernels</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Port-saturated code:</strong> if the FMA or load ports are already busy every cycle, a bigger window finds work it has nowhere to send.</li>
<li><strong>Mispredict-bound code:</strong> when branches mispredict often, much of the window is wrong-path work that gets flushed (see <a href="#/rob-sizing">Sizing the Reorder Buffer</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth-bound streaming:</strong> once DRAM bandwidth is saturated, exposing more misses only lengthens queues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec-cost">What It Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Area and power:</strong> the issue queue and LSQ are CAMs searched every cycle, and the rename tables and PRF are heavily multi-ported. Energy per instruction is several times that of a simple in-order pipeline, which is why Arm's efficiency cores (Cortex-A510, A520) stay in-order.</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline depth:</strong> rename, dispatch, and the wakeup/select loop add stages between fetch and execute, which raises the branch-mispredict penalty.</li>
<li><strong>Wasted work:</strong> every mispredict throws away the speculative work in the window, and the energy spent on it.</li>
<li><strong>Verification and complexity:</strong> recovery, memory ordering, and speculative wakeup are hard to get right and are a source of side channels such as Spectre.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec-static">The Static Alternative</h3>
<p>VLIW and EPIC designs move scheduling into the compiler. Itanium is the well-known case: it ran dense floating-point kernels well, where schedules are predictable, but fell behind on integer code dominated by cache misses and hard-to-predict branches, which is exactly where static scheduling lacks information. DSPs and GPUs stay in-order because their workloads are mostly kernels. GPUs hide memory latency by switching among many threads instead of reordering one thread's instructions.</p>
<h3 id="sec-measure">Telling the Regimes Apart</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run the same binary on an in-order and an out-of-order model:</strong> a small IPC gap means the code is chain-bound, port-bound, or already statically scheduled.</li>
<li><strong>Measure average outstanding L1D misses (MLP):</strong> MLP well above 1 on the out-of-order model, against near 1 on the in-order one, accounts for most of the gap.</li>
<li><strong>Check port utilization and the critical path:</strong> if the dataflow critical path or a saturated port already sets the cycle count, window and scheduler changes won't move IPC.</li>

<p>An out-of-order core runs far ahead of the last instruction it knows is correct. When a guess turns out wrong, or an instruction can't complete, the core must remove every instruction younger than some point, the <strong>squash point</strong>, and put every structure back the way it was when that point was renamed. Two facts make this cheap. Nothing past the squash point has committed, so architectural state (committed registers, memory) is untouched. And with renaming, speculative values live in physical registers that no committed mapping points to. So recovery is bookkeeping: maps, pointers, and valid bits, never data. Main sources: Hennessy and Patterson (chapter 3, hardware speculation and the reorder buffer), Smith and Pleszkun's paper on precise interrupts (1988), Yeager's description of the MIPS R10000 (IEEE Micro, 1996), the BOOM documentation, and Akkary, Rajwar, and Srinivasan on checkpoint processing and recovery (MICRO 2003).</p>

</table></div>
<p>Intel's performance counters call every flush except a branch mispredict a <strong>machine clear</strong> (<code>MACHINE_CLEARS.MEMORY_ORDERING</code>, <code>MACHINE_CLEARS.SMC</code>, and so on). The distinction that matters most for the hardware is whether the squash point is at the ROB head (everything uncommitted goes) or somewhere in the middle (older instructions keep running).</p>

<h3 id="sec-squash-point">Marking the Squash Point</h3>
<p>Every structure needs a way to tell, in parallel and in about a cycle, which of its entries are younger than the squash point. Two schemes are common:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age by ROB index:</strong> each micro-op carries its ROB index plus a wrap bit. An entry is younger than the squash point if its index comes after the squash index in circular order. The wrap bit is what lets a comparator tell "after" from "before" once the indices wrap around the end of the ROB.</li>
<li><strong>Branch masks:</strong> each unresolved branch gets a tag, one of N bits. Every micro-op carries a mask with the bits of all unresolved branches older than it. When branch k mispredicts, every entry with bit k set is killed. When branch k resolves correctly, bit k is cleared in every mask and the tag is free again. The MIPS R10000 (4 tags) and BOOM work this way. The number of tags caps unresolved branches in flight: when they run out, rename stalls at the next branch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Branch masks only cover branches. A squash point at a load or at the ROB head needs either age comparison or a full flush.</p>

<h3 id="sec-front-end">Clearing the Front End</h3>
<p>Everything between fetch and rename is younger than everything in the back end, so the front end is flushed wholesale, with no age checks: the fetch target queue, fetch and decode buffers, the micro-op queue, and the rename stage's pipeline latches. Then fetch is redirected to the new PC, which comes from the branch unit (the correct target), from the ROB (the load's PC for an ordering violation), or from the trap logic (the handler).</p>
<p>The branch predictor's speculative state is repaired too:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global history:</strong> restored to its value at the branch, with the correct outcome shifted in (see <a href="#/fe-direction/update">Speculative History and Repair</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Return address stack:</strong> the top pointer is restored, and often the one entry a wrong-path call overwrote (see <a href="#/fe-targets/ras">The Return Address Stack</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Not restored:</strong> the predictor tables, caches, and TLBs. Tables usually update at resolution or retirement anyway. Lines that wrong-path loads brought into the cache stay there, which is what Spectre-style attacks read.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-rename">Restoring the Rename Map and Free List</h3>
<p>The rename map (RAT) is the one structure whose contents, not just pointers, change with every renamed instruction, so it is the hard part of recovery (see <a href="#/renaming">Register Renaming</a>). There are three ways back:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Checkpoint:</strong> a full copy of the RAT is saved when a branch is renamed. Recovery copies it back in one cycle. Fast, but each checkpoint costs area and the number of checkpoints limits unresolved branches.</li>
<li><strong>ROB walk:</strong> every ROB entry with a destination holds its architectural register, its new physical register, and the physical register it replaced. Walking from the tail back to the squash point, each entry writes its old mapping back into the RAT and returns its new register to the free list. Walking youngest first means the last write to each architectural register comes from the oldest squashed instruction, which holds the mapping from just before the squash point. No extra storage, but it takes (squashed entries ÷ walk width) cycles. A variant starts from the retirement RAT and walks forward from the ROB head to the squash point, re-applying mappings, which is faster when the squash point is near the head.</li>
<li><strong>Copy the retirement RAT:</strong> the retirement RAT always holds the committed mapping. If the squash point is the ROB head, so every uncommitted instruction goes, copying it into the speculative RAT is the whole recovery. This is how exceptions, interrupts, and commit-time recoveries work.</li>
</ol>
<p>The free list must give back every register the squashed instructions took:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIFO free list (R10000):</strong> rename takes registers from the head, and commit returns them at the tail. The checkpoint saves the head pointer, and restoring it puts the squashed registers back in one step. Registers freed at commit in the meantime were added at the tail, so they aren't lost.</li>
<li><strong>Bit-vector free list (BOOM):</strong> each checkpoint keeps a mask of registers allocated since that branch. Recovery ORs the mask back into the free vector.</li>
<li><strong>Retirement copy:</strong> on a full flush, the free registers are exactly those the retirement RAT doesn't point to, minus any that committed instructions haven't freed yet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-prf">Why the Register File Needs No Restore</h3>
<p>No data is copied back into the physical register file. Committed values live in registers the retirement RAT points to, and no in-flight instruction can write those, since every writer gets a fresh register. Squashed values sit in registers that simply return to the free list. Older designs without a merged register file had to restore data: Smith and Pleszkun's history buffer saved old values and copied them back on a fault, and a future file needed the architectural file copied over it. Renaming with a merged physical file is what reduced recovery to resetting maps.</p>
<p>One thing does need care: a squashed instruction already in an execution pipe must not write its destination. That register may have been reallocated by the time the result arrives, and the write would corrupt the new owner's value or set its ready bit early. So kill information (the branch mask or age) travels with every micro-op down the execute pipes, and writeback, the ready-bit update, and the wakeup broadcast are all gated on it.</p>

<h3 id="sec-rob">The Reorder Buffer</h3>
<p>The ROB is a circular buffer, so recovery is a pointer move: the tail is set to the entry just after the branch (for a mispredict) or to the load (for an ordering violation). Entries between the new and old tail are now free. For a flush at the head, the tail is set equal to the head and the ROB is empty. The squashed entries' contents are only used if recovery walks them first.</p>

<h3 id="sec-scheduler">Scheduler Queues and Execution Pipes</h3>
<p>Issue queue entries are not in program order, so they can't be freed by moving a pointer. Each entry compares its branch mask or age against the squash point and clears its valid bit, all entries in parallel (see <a href="#/scheduler">Scheduler Queues</a>). Surviving older entries keep waiting and issuing as before. Some more details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-flight operations:</strong> micro-ops already issued are killed in their pipes, as above. A long iterative operation, such as a divide, is aborted so the unit frees up.</li>
<li><strong>Speculative wakeups:</strong> dependents woken by a squashed load's speculative wakeup are squashed too, since they are younger still.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed queues:</strong> every per-port queue receives the same kill signal in the same cycle. That signal fans out to every entry in the core, which is one reason recovery logic is timing-critical.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-lsq">Load and Store Queues</h3>
<p>The load and store queues are allocated in program order at dispatch, so, like the ROB, they recover by moving tail pointers. Each checkpoint (or the branch's own ROB entry) records the LQ and SQ tails at the time the branch was renamed (see <a href="#/lsq">Load and Store Queues</a>). Then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Squashed loads</strong> are dropped. If one has a cache miss outstanding, the MSHR usually still completes the fill and installs the line, but nothing is woken up. The load acted as a prefetch.</li>
<li><strong>Squashed stores</strong> never wrote the cache, so they just disappear.</li>
<li><strong>Committed stores</strong> waiting in the store buffer are architectural. They are older than any squash point and keep draining to the cache, even across an exception or interrupt.</li>
<li><strong>Memory dependence predictor:</strong> entries that point at squashed stores must be cleared or checked for validity, or a load could wait forever for a store that will never issue (see <a href="#/mdp/store-sets">Store Sets</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>An ordering violation's squash point is the load itself, so the load and everything after it run again, this time reading the store's value.</p>

<h3 id="sec-checkpoints">Checkpointing</h3>
<p>A checkpoint is everything that recovery to one point needs that can't be found by moving a pointer:</p>
<div class="tbl"><table>
<tr><th>State</th><th>What is saved</th><th>Size</th></tr>
<tr><td>Rename map</td><td>A full copy of the speculative RAT</td><td>Architectural registers × log<sub>2</sub>(physical registers) bits per register class</td></tr>
<tr><td>Free list</td><td>The head pointer, or a mask of registers allocated since the checkpoint</td><td>A pointer, or one bit per physical register</td></tr>
<tr><td>ROB, LQ, SQ</td><td>The tail pointers (the ROB tail is implied by the branch's own index)</td><td>A pointer plus a wrap bit each</td></tr>
<tr><td>Branch predictor</td><td>The global history pointer, the RAS top pointer, sometimes the overwritten RAS entry</td><td>Tens of bits</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>The rename map dominates. For x86-64's 16 integer registers and a 280-entry integer register file (Golden Cove's size), the integer map alone is 16 × 9 = 144 bits, and the vector map adds as much again. The copy must be written in a single cycle, so each checkpoint is a full-width, shadow copy wired next to the RAT, not a slow RAM.</p>
<p>Where to take checkpoints is the design choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At every branch:</strong> recovery is always one cycle, but checkpoints run out in branch-dense code and stall rename. The R10000 had 4, which limited it to 4 unresolved branches.</li>
<li><strong>Only at low-confidence branches:</strong> a confidence estimator picks the branches likely to mispredict. A mispredict at an uncheckpointed branch restores the nearest checkpoint and walks the few ROB entries between it and the branch, or, in Akkary and colleagues' design, re-executes from the older checkpoint.</li>
<li><strong>No checkpoints:</strong> every recovery walks the ROB. Cheapest in area, slowest to recover, and the walk time grows with the window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Intel added a Branch Order Buffer in Nehalem so that rename state could be recovered as soon as a mispredicted branch executed, rather than waiting for it to retire. Recovering early matters because the branch may sit behind a long-latency load for hundreds of cycles.</p>

<h3 id="sec-compare">Three Kinds of Flush Side by Side</h3>
<div class="tbl"><table>
<tr><th>Structure</th><th>Branch mispredict (recovered at execute)</th><th>Memory-ordering violation (recovered at commit)</th><th>Fault, trap, or interrupt</th></tr>
<tr><td>Front end</td><td>Flushed, redirected to the correct target</td><td>Flushed, redirected to the load</td><td>Flushed, redirected to the handler</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rename map</td><td>From the branch's checkpoint, or a ROB walk</td><td>Copy of the retirement RAT</td><td>Copy of the retirement RAT</td></tr>
<tr><td>Free list</td><td>From the checkpoint, or returned during the walk</td><td>Rebuilt from the committed state</td><td>Rebuilt from the committed state</td></tr>
<tr><td>ROB</td><td>Tail moved to just after the branch</td><td>Emptied (the load is at the head)</td><td>Emptied</td></tr>
<tr><td>Issue queues and pipes</td><td>Younger entries killed, older keep going</td><td>All killed</td><td>All killed</td></tr>
<tr><td>LQ and SQ</td><td>Tails restored</td><td>Emptied</td><td>Emptied</td></tr>
<tr><td>Store buffer (committed stores)</td><td>Keeps draining</td><td>Keeps draining</td><td>Keeps draining</td></tr>
<tr><td>Predictor history</td><td>Restored from the branch's checkpoint, outcome shifted in</td><td>Restored to the state at the load</td><td>Restored to the committed state</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>A recovery at the ROB head is simpler, because every structure resets to empty or to its committed copy, but it waits for everything older to retire. A recovery in the middle is faster, but needs checkpoints or a walk plus selective kills everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="sec-exceptions">Flushing for Faults, Traps, and Interrupts</h3>
<p>A faulting instruction does nothing at first: the unit that finds the problem writes an exception code into its ROB entry. If an older branch turns out mispredicted, the ordinary branch flush removes that entry and the fault never happened. Only when the entry reaches the ROB head is the exception taken, which is what makes it precise (see <a href="#/exceptions/out-order-core">Making the Exception Precise</a>). At that point:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flush everything uncommitted:</strong> the front end, ROB, issue queues, execute pipes, and LQ and SQ, including the faulting instruction itself.</li>
<li><strong>Restore committed state:</strong> the speculative RAT is overwritten by the retirement RAT, and the free list and predictor history are rebuilt from committed state. No checkpoint is needed, since the squash point is the head.</li>
<li><strong>Keep committed stores:</strong> the store buffer goes on draining, since those stores are architectural.</li>
<li><strong>Enter the handler:</strong> the core saves the resume PC and the cause, records the old privilege level, raises privilege, and jumps to the trap vector. That user-to-kernel transition is described in <a href="#/exceptions/hardware-sequence">The Hardware Sequence</a> and <a href="#/exceptions/privilege-levels">Privilege Levels</a>. The way back, <code>sret</code>, <code>eret</code>, or <code>iretq</code>, is in <a href="#/exceptions/return">Returning to User Mode</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the flush removes every instruction fetched under the old privilege level, no instruction ever runs in kernel mode with user-mode assumptions, or the reverse. Mode changes on return are handled the same way: the return instruction usually serializes, draining the window so that fetch restarts at the resume PC under the new mode. An interrupt has no faulting instruction, so the core picks a boundary, flushes everything uncommitted, and saves the oldest uncommitted PC as the resume point. For the full list of events that trap and what the kernel does with each, see <a href="#/exceptions">Faults, Traps, Interrupts, and System Calls</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec-cost">What a Flush Costs</h3>
<ul>

  body: `
<p>A wide out-of-order core rarely fills its issue slots from one thread: dependences, mispredicts, and cache misses leave most of them empty. <strong>Simultaneous multithreading (SMT)</strong> runs two or more hardware threads on one core at the same time, so one thread's idle slots can be filled with another's work.</p>

<h3 id="sec-idea">The Idea</h3>
<p>Tullsen, Eggers, and Levy (1995) compared three ways to use a superscalar core's slots: coarse-grained multithreading (switch threads on a long stall), fine-grained multithreading (switch every cycle), and SMT (issue from several threads in the same cycle). Only SMT fills both kinds of waste: <em>vertical</em> waste (cycles where nothing issues) and <em>horizontal</em> waste (cycles where only some slots are used). Intel shipped it as Hyper-Threading in 2002; AMD's Zen cores, IBM's POWER (up to 8 threads per core), and some Arm Neoverse cores also use it.</p>
<p>The extra hardware is modest: a second copy of the architectural state (register mapping table, PC, some control registers), thread IDs on shared structures, and policies for sharing. The physical register file, caches, execution units, and most queues are already there.</p>

<h3 id="sec-sharing">Shared, Partitioned, and Replicated</h3>
<div class="tbl"><table>
<tr><th>Policy</th><th>Typical structures</th><th>Why</th></tr>
<tr><td>Replicated</td><td>Architectural register map, PC, return stack, some predictor history</td><td>Each thread needs its own copy for correctness</td></tr>
<tr><td>Statically partitioned when both threads run</td><td>ROB, load and store queues, micro-op queue (on Intel cores; AMD statically splits several queues too)</td><td>Guarantees each thread a share, so one stalled thread can't fill the whole structure</td></tr>
<tr><td>Competitively shared</td><td>Schedulers, physical registers, caches, TLBs, branch predictor tables</td><td>Better use when threads differ, at the risk of one thread crowding out the other</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>When only one thread is active, partitioned structures recombine, so single-thread performance is close to that of a core without SMT.</p>

<h3 id="sec-fetch">Fetch Policy</h3>
<p>Which thread fetches each cycle decides who gets the shared back end. Round-robin is simple but lets a thread stuck on a miss fill the queues with instructions that can't issue. Tullsen et al.'s <strong>ICOUNT</strong> policy (1996) fetches from the thread with the fewest instructions in the front end and queues, which favors threads that are making progress and keeps either from clogging the scheduler. Many later policies refine this by also throttling threads with outstanding long misses.</p>

<h3 id="sec-gains">What It Gains and Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Throughput:</strong> typically 10 to 30% more total work per core on server and mixed workloads, more when threads are often stalled on memory, little or none when one thread already saturates the execution units (dense floating-point kernels).</li>
<li><strong>Per-thread latency:</strong> each thread runs slower than it would alone, because it shares the core. Latency-sensitive services sometimes turn SMT off for this reason.</li>
<li><strong>Cache and TLB contention:</strong> two working sets share L1, L2, and the TLBs; when they don't fit, both threads can lose.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> threads on one core share microarchitectural state, which has enabled cross-thread side channels (see <a href="#/side-channels">Speculative Side Channels</a>); some systems disable SMT or schedule only mutually trusting threads together.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-model">Measuring and Modeling SMT</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report both throughput and fairness.</strong> Weighted speedup sums each thread's IPC with SMT divided by its IPC alone; it counts each thread's progress relative to what it could do. Harmonic speedup or the maximum slowdown shows whether one thread is being starved.</li>
<li><strong>Pick co-runner pairs deliberately:</strong> memory-bound with compute-bound, two memory-bound, two identical threads. Gains depend heavily on the pairing.</li>
<li><strong>Model the partitioning rules exactly,</strong> including when a structure switches between partitioned and shared modes, and thread-aware arbitration at every shared port.</li>

If the target can't be met with SMT on at the needed load, disable it only on the cores that serve requests and keep it for background work.</p>`

<p>One SIMD instruction does the same operation on many elements: eight 64-bit additions, sixteen single-precision multiplies, sixty-four byte compares. It is the cheapest way to raise a core's throughput, because the expensive per-instruction work (fetch, decode, rename, scheduling, retire) is paid once for many operations.</p>

<h3 id="sec-why">Why SIMD</h3>
<p>As <a href="#/perf-power/costs">Power and Energy Modeling</a> shows, a scalar add costs far less energy than the machinery around it. Widening the operation amortizes that overhead: a 512-bit FMA does 16 single-precision multiply-adds for roughly the front-end and scheduling energy of one scalar instruction. Hennessy and Patterson's data-level parallelism chapter frames this as the main alternative to more cores for regular computations.</p>

</table></div>
<p>Fixed-width ISAs need a new instruction set extension each time the width grows, and loops need separate remainder code for the last few elements. Vector-length-agnostic ISAs write the loop once: each iteration asks the hardware how many elements it will process, and predication handles the tail.</p>

<h3 id="sec-datapath">Register Width vs. Datapath Width</h3>
<p>The ISA fixes the register width; the microarchitecture chooses how wide the execution units are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD's Zen 4 executes AVX-512 on 256-bit units, splitting each 512-bit operation into two halves. It gains the ISA's benefits (masks, more registers, fewer instructions to decode) without doubling the datapaths; Zen 5 widens them to 512 bits on its desktop and server parts.</li>
<li>Intel's server cores since Skylake-SP have two 512-bit FMA units (on most SKUs): 2 FMAs × 8 doubles × 2 FLOPs = 32 double-precision FLOPs per cycle per core.</li>
<li>Arm's Neoverse V1 implements SVE with two 256-bit pipes; Neoverse V2 uses four 128-bit pipes. Same ISA, different width, same binaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Width costs more than execution units: register file ports and capacity, load and store paths (a 512-bit load per cycle per port), and bypass wiring all scale with it.</p>

<h3 id="sec-freq">Power and Frequency</h3>
<p>Wide SIMD units draw a lot of current when busy. Intel's Skylake-SP server cores lowered their maximum frequency when running heavy 256-bit or 512-bit instructions (frequency "licenses"), and the lower clock persisted for a short time afterward, so occasional AVX-512 instructions in mostly scalar code could slow the scalar code too. Later Intel cores reduced the penalty considerably, and AMD's Zen 4 doesn't apply a separate AVX-512 clock limit. A model of vector code on such parts must include the frequency effect, or it will overstate the gain.</p>

<h3 id="sec-hard">What Vectorizes Poorly</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control flow:</strong> branches inside the loop become masked operations on both paths; when paths are long and rarely taken, the work grows.</li>
<li><strong>Irregular memory:</strong> gathers and scatters load or store each element separately, at a few cycles per element, so a gather-heavy loop gains little.</li>
<li><strong>Dependences across iterations:</strong> loop-carried dependences (prefix sums, recurrences) need special algorithms or don't vectorize.</li>
<li><strong>Short loops:</strong> with a trip count of 5 on 16-wide vectors, most lanes are idle.</li>
<li><strong>Amdahl:</strong> the scalar part limits the speedup no matter how wide the vectors are.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-model">Modeling Vector Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>Count micro-ops per vector instruction on the target (split operations, gathers that become many micro-ops) rather than one per instruction.</li>
<li>Model load and store bandwidth in bytes, not instructions; wide vectors usually hit the L1 or L2 bandwidth bound before the FMA bound (see the bytes-per-cycle rows on <a href="#/perf-bounds/mem-bounds">Memory Bounds</a>).</li>
<li>Include the frequency behavior of the part being modeled.</li>

<p>Speculation is architecturally invisible: squashed instructions never change registers or memory. But they do change <em>microarchitectural</em> state, such as which lines are in the cache, and that state can be measured by timing. Since 2018, this gap has been the source of a family of vulnerabilities that changed how cores are designed and added real costs that performance models must include.</p>

<h3 id="sec-channel">Timing Channels Through the Cache</h3>
<p>A cache hit and a miss differ by hundreds of cycles, which a program can measure with a cycle counter. That makes the cache a channel: whether a line is cached encodes a bit. The standard techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flush+Reload:</strong> with memory shared between two parties (a shared library page, for example), flush a line, wait, then time a reload. Fast means someone touched it.</li>
<li><strong>Prime+Probe:</strong> without shared memory, fill a cache set with your own lines, wait, then time re-accessing them. Slow means someone else's line evicted one of yours.</li>
</ul>
<p>On their own, these leak access patterns of code that touches memory based on secrets (the reason crypto code is written to be constant-time). Combined with speculation, they leak data the program never architecturally reads.</p>

<h3 id="sec-transient">Transient Execution</h3>
<p>The general pattern (Kocher et al., 2019; Lipp et al., 2018):</p>
<ol>
<li>The core speculates past something: a predicted branch, a predicted target, an access whose permission check finishes later.</li>
<li>On the wrong path, an instruction reads a value the program isn't allowed to use.</li>
<li>A dependent load uses that value to form an address, bringing a value-dependent line into the cache.</li>
<li>The speculation is squashed and the registers are restored, but the cache line stays.</li>
<li>A timing measurement recovers which line was loaded, and so the value.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each step is a normal performance feature. The flaw is only in the combination.</p>

<h3 id="sec-mitigations">Mitigations and What They Cost</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel page-table isolation (KPTI):</strong> the kernel is unmapped while user code runs, so a Meltdown-style load has nothing to read. Each system call and interrupt switches page tables; with PCID-tagged TLBs the cost is a few hundred cycles per entry and exit, without them a TLB flush too. Cores fixed in hardware don't need it.</li>
<li><strong>Speculation barriers and index masking</strong> for Spectre v1: an <code>lfence</code> after a bounds check (serializing, tens of cycles) or, more cheaply, masking the index so a mispredicted path can only reach in-bounds memory.</li>
<li><strong>Retpolines and hardware controls</strong> for Spectre v2: replacing indirect branches with a construct the predictor can't steer, or hardware modes (enhanced IBRS) that keep predictor entries from crossing privilege levels, plus predictor flushes (IBPB) on context switches between untrusted processes.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer clearing</strong> for MDS: overwriting the affected buffers on every kernel exit (<code>verw</code>), and on affected parts, disabling SMT where untrusted threads could share a core.</li>
<li><strong>Speculative store bypass disable:</strong> turning off memory dependence prediction for a process, so loads wait for older store addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The costs land unevenly: system-call-heavy and context-switch-heavy workloads (databases, networking, virtualization) pay the most; compute loops pay almost nothing. A performance model that omits the mitigations the deployed system will use mispredicts exactly those workloads.</p>

<h3 id="sec-design">Designing for It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Close specific paths in hardware:</strong> newer cores check permissions before forwarding loaded data, tag predictor entries by privilege level and context, and clear buffers on domain changes.</li>
<li><strong>Restrict what speculative instructions can do:</strong> research designs such as speculative taint tracking (Yu et al., 2019) let speculative loads execute but block their results from forming new addresses until the speculation resolves, at a modest IPC cost.</li>

        q: `<p>A database server makes about 300,000 system calls per second per core on a 3 GHz part that needs KPTI. Each kernel entry and exit adds about 400 cycles with PCID support, and about 1,500 without (TLB refills included). Estimate the overhead both ways. What would you tell a team modeling this server's next-generation core?</p>`,
        a: `<p>With PCID: 300,000 × 400 = 120 million cycles per second, <strong>4%</strong> of 3 billion. Without: 300,000 × 1,500 = 450 million, <strong>15%</strong>. For the modeling team: system-call and interrupt rates, and the mitigations active on the deployed system, are workload parameters as important as cache miss rates for this server. If the new core fixes Meltdown in hardware, KPTI can be turned off and that 4 to 15% comes back, which may be worth more than many microarchitectural features; the model should include it explicitly, and the benchmarks should run with the mitigation settings customers will use.</p>`
