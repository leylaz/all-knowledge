<h3 id="sec-address-spaces">Address Spaces</h3>
<p>Each process sees its own virtual address space. The hardware translates every virtual address (VA) to a physical address (PA) using page tables managed by the OS. This gives isolation, lets physical memory be fragmented while virtual memory looks contiguous, and allows sharing and lazy allocation.</p>
<h3 id="sec-pages-page-tables">Pages and Page Tables</h3>
<p>Memory is divided into pages (commonly 4 KB; 16 KB on Apple's ARM systems). A VA splits into a virtual page number and an offset; translation maps the page number to a physical frame and keeps the offset.</p>
<p>A page table entry holds the frame number plus permission and status bits: present, read/write, execute-disable, user/supervisor, accessed, and dirty.</p>
<h3 id="sec-multilevel">Why Multilevel</h3>
<p>A flat table for a 48-bit address space with 4 KB pages needs 2<sup>36</sup> entries × 8 bytes = 512 GB per process. A multilevel (radix) table only allocates the parts actually used. On x86-64, each level indexes 9 bits into a 4 KB table of 512 entries: 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 12 = 48 bits. A fifth level extends this to 57 bits.</p>
<h3 id="sec-tlbs">TLBs</h3>
<p>Walking four levels of table on every access would be far too slow, so the core caches recent translations in TLBs, tagged by address space so a context switch doesn't flush them. Reach, page walks, page-walk caches, and nested walks under virtualization are in <a href="#/tlb">TLBs and Page Walks</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec-demand-paging-cow">Demand Paging and Copy-on-Write</h3>
<p>The OS maps pages lazily: the first touch of a page faults, and the kernel fills in the entry then. After <code>fork</code>, parent and child share pages read-only until one of them writes. Both are covered in <a href="#/demand-paging">Demand Paging and Copy-on-Write</a>, and programs create their own mappings with <code>mmap</code>, covered in <a href="#/mmap">Memory Mapping</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec-interaction-caches">Interaction with Caches</h3>
<p>A VIPT L1 indexes with untranslated offset bits while the TLB translates the tag in parallel, which bounds L1 size to page size × ways. See <a href="#/dcache">Data cache</a>.</p>

<p>Every load, store, and instruction fetch needs its virtual address translated before (or while) the cache is accessed. <a href="#/virtual-memory">Virtual and Physical Memory</a> covers the OS side; this page covers the hardware that makes translation fast and what it costs when it isn't.</p>

<h3 id="sec-hierarchy">The TLB Hierarchy</h3>
<p>Translation is cached in TLBs organized like data caches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>L1 TLBs</strong>, separate for instructions and data, small (tens of entries) and fast enough to look up in parallel with the L1 cache. With a virtually indexed, physically tagged L1, the cache set is chosen from page-offset bits while the TLB translates the rest, so translation adds no latency on a hit.</li>
<li><strong>A shared L2 TLB</strong> (thousands of entries) behind them, a few cycles slower. Zen 4, for example, has a 72-entry L1 DTLB and a 3,072-entry L2 DTLB.</li>
<li>Entries carry the page size, permissions, and an address-space tag (ASID or PCID) so context switches don't need a flush.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-reach">TLB Reach and Huge Pages</h3>
<p><strong>Reach</strong> is how much memory the TLB covers: entries × page size. With 4 KB pages, a 3,072-entry L2 TLB reaches 12 MB, smaller than many last-level caches, so a workload can hit in L3 and still miss in the TLB on every access. With 2 MB pages the same entries reach 6 GB.</p>
<p>That is why large-memory workloads (databases, JVMs, HPC codes, in-memory key-value stores) use huge pages, through explicit reservations or the kernel's transparent huge pages. The costs: memory fragmentation, internal waste for sparse data, and slower page faults (zeroing 2 MB at once).</p>

<h3 id="sec-walk">What a Page Walk Does</h3>
<p>On an L2 TLB miss, a hardware <strong>page walker</strong> reads the page table. On x86-64 with 4-level paging, a 48-bit virtual address splits into four 9-bit indices and a 12-bit offset:</p>
<pre><code>bits 47..39  PML4 index   -&gt; read PML4 entry  (memory reference 0)
bits 38..30  PDPT index   -&gt; read PDPT entry  (memory reference 1; a 1 GB page stops here)
bits 29..21  PD index     -&gt; read PD entry    (memory reference 2; a 2 MB page stops here)
bits 20..12  PT index     -&gt; read PT entry    (memory reference 3)
bits 11..0   page offset</code></pre>
<p>Each step is a dependent load: the next table's address comes from the entry just read. The walker's loads go through the data caches, so a walk whose entries are all in L1 or L2 costs tens of cycles, while one that misses to DRAM at every level costs several DRAM latencies. 5-level paging (57-bit addresses) adds a fifth level, and Armv8 and RISC-V Sv48 work the same way with their own table formats.</p>

<h3 id="sec-pwc">Page-Walk Caches and Walkers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page-walk caches</strong> (Intel's paging-structure caches) keep recently used upper-level entries, so most walks skip straight to the last one or two levels. The upper levels cover huge regions, so a few dozen entries hit almost always.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple walkers:</strong> a core with one walker serializes all TLB misses; Intel went from one to two walkers in Broadwell, and recent cores have more. Walkers act like MSHRs for translation: their count caps how many TLB misses overlap.</li>
<li><strong>Prefetching and speculation:</strong> walks can start for speculative loads, and some cores prefetch translations for the next page in a streaming pattern.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-virt">Virtualization: Two-Dimensional Walks</h3>
<p>Under hardware virtualization (Intel EPT, AMD NPT), the guest's page table holds guest-physical addresses, and each of them must itself be translated through the host's table. With 4 levels on each side, a walk can need up to (4 + 1) × (4 + 1) − 1 = <strong>24</strong> memory references: each of the guest's 4 table reads and the final guest-physical address needs a host walk of up to 4 references, plus the 4 guest reads themselves. Page-walk caches for both dimensions and huge pages on the host side are what keep virtualized TLB misses affordable.</p>

<h3 id="sec-model">Modeling Translation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Model the walk as real loads through the cache hierarchy, not a fixed latency; walk cost depends on whether page-table lines are cached, which depends on the workload's footprint.</li>
<li>Model the number of walkers and page-walk caches, since they set translation's MLP.</li>
<li>Use the page sizes the real system would use: a simulator that hands out 4 KB pages for a workload that runs on 2 MB pages in production overstates TLB misses enormously, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Count TLB shootdowns and context switches if the workload has them; trace-driven models usually don't see them.</li>

<p>Once every access goes through a page table, the OS can point any virtual page at any physical frame, or at nothing yet. Two features fall out of that one layer of indirection: loading pages only when they are touched (demand paging), and letting processes share a page until one of them writes to it (copy-on-write). Both work by having the CPU, the OS, and user code see different things about the same page, and both rely on the page fault being precise and restartable (see <a href="#/exceptions">Faults, Traps, Interrupts, and System Calls</a>). The next page, <a href="#/mmap">Memory Mapping</a>, hands the same machinery to the program. Builds on <a href="#/virtual-memory">Virtual and Physical Memory</a>. Main sources: Bryant and O’Hallaron’s <em>Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective</em> (chapter 9) and Chris Kanich’s CS 361 lecture on memory mapping.</p>

<h3 id="sec-indirection">The Page Table as a Layer of Indirection</h3>
<p>Each process has its own page table, and each table maps virtual pages to physical frames however the OS likes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many to one:</strong> two virtual pages, in the same process or in different ones, can map to the same frame. That is how processes share code and memory.</li>
<li><strong>Not yet:</strong> an entry can be marked not present, so the first access faults and the OS decides what to put there.</li>
<li><strong>Lie about permissions:</strong> the entry can be stricter than what the program was promised, so the OS gets control on the first write.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table only works in one direction: given a virtual page, find the frame. Going from a frame back to every virtual page that maps it (needed to evict a shared page or to tell whether a page still has other users) takes a separate structure. Linux keeps a <strong>reverse map</strong> for this, and a per-frame count of how many page tables map it.</p>
<p>Three parties take part, and keeping them apart is the key to every example below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The CPU</strong> reads the page table on every TLB miss and faults when an entry is not present or forbids the access.</li>
<li><strong>The OS</strong> writes the page table and handles the faults. It also keeps its own description of each region (on Linux, a VMA per region: its range, its real permissions, and what backs it), which can differ from the page table.</li>
<li><strong>User code</strong> sees neither. It loads and stores, and a fault that the OS fixes is invisible to it apart from the time it took.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-backing">Demand Paging and Backing Objects</h3>
<p>Every region of a process's address space is backed by an object, and its pages start out not present. The mapping already says where each page's bytes come from, but they aren't read until the first touch faults them in. Pages that are never touched cost no memory and no I/O. Regions are created by <code>exec</code> when a program starts and by <code>mmap</code> afterward. The backing object is one of two kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A regular file:</strong> page <em>i</em> of the region holds bytes <em>i</em> × 4096 onward of the file (plus the mapping's starting offset). The fault reads the page into the page cache if it isn't already there, then maps that page-cache frame.</li>
<li><strong>An anonymous object:</strong> memory with no file behind it, which reads as all zeros at first. These are called <strong>demand-zero</strong> pages: the fault hands out a freshly zeroed frame. On Linux, a read fault on an untouched anonymous page maps one shared, read-only <strong>zero page</strong> instead, so a region that is only read never uses more than that one frame. The first write then gets a private zeroed frame.</li>

<p>Demand paging is lazy evaluation for memory: like not studying for an exam you won't take, the OS does no work for a page until an instruction actually needs it. A <strong>minor fault</strong> finds the bytes already in memory (a zero page, or a file page already in the page cache) and costs on the order of a microsecond. A <strong>major fault</strong> waits for storage: tens of microseconds on an NVMe SSD, milliseconds on a disk. Readahead hides much of this for sequential access by pulling in neighboring file pages before they are touched.</p>

<h3 id="sec-cow">Copy-on-Write After Fork</h3>
<p><code>fork</code> must give the child an address space identical to the parent's, after which the two must not see each other's writes. Copying every frame would be slow and wasteful, especially since most children call <code>exec</code> immediately. Copying only the page table would be fast but wrong, since the processes would then share writable frames. Copy-on-write does both: share now, copy at the last possible moment, one page at a time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At fork,</strong> the kernel copies the parent's page table into the child. Every private writable page is set to read-only in <em>both</em> tables, and each frame's map count goes up. The regions themselves (the VMAs) stay writable: the OS remembers the truth even though the page table says otherwise. Already read-only pages, such as code, simply stay shared forever.</li>
<li><strong>User code stores to a private page.</strong> It believes the page is writable, because it is.</li>
<li><strong>The CPU</strong> sees a read-only entry and raises a page fault. It knows nothing about copy-on-write.</li>
<li><strong>The OS</strong> sees a write fault on a page that the region says is writable, so the fault is legal. If other page tables still map the frame, it allocates a new frame, copies the 4 KiB, points the writer's entry at the copy with write permission, and invalidates the stale TLB entry. If the writer is now the only one mapping the frame, it just makes the entry writable, with no copy.</li>
<li><strong>The store re-executes</strong> and succeeds. The program never knew.</li>
</ol>

<p>The net effect: after a fork, physical memory grows by one page per page actually written, not by the size of the process. Pages that are never written, such as globals touched only on an error path, are never copied. The same trick serves file-backed <a href="#/mmap/flags"><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code></a> mappings like <code>.data</code>, and anonymous memory, whose untouched pages are copy-on-write views of the zero page.</p>

<h3 id="sec-spawn">Starting a New Program: Exec and Spawn</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>exec</code></strong> throws away the address space and builds a new one: new regions pointing at the new executable's file offsets, all not present. No memory is used until the program starts touching its pages, and the page cache and readahead usually have the hot pages ready before they are needed.</li>
<li><strong><code>fork</code> then <code>exec</code></strong> still pays for the fork: copying the page table and write-protecting every writable page of the parent, even though the child is about to discard all of it. For a parent with tens of gigabytes mapped, that is tens of megabytes of page-table entries to copy, then a write fault on the first store to each page.</li>
<li><strong><code>posix_spawn</code></strong> avoids the copy. glibc implements it with <code>clone(CLONE_VM | CLONE_VFORK)</code>: the child runs on the parent's own page table, with no copy and no write-protection, while the parent waits. The child does only a fixed list of safe steps (the file actions, such as redirecting descriptors), then calls <code>exec</code>, at which point the parent resumes. Because those steps are known not to disturb the parent's memory, sharing the address space for that short window is safe.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-perf">Performance Trade-Offs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faults are not free.</strong> A minor fault costs roughly 0.5 to 1 µs of kernel time, plus zeroing or copying the page. Touching a fresh 4 KiB page per microsecond of work halves throughput. Ways to batch this work are in <a href="#/mmap/perf">Memory Mapping</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Copy-on-write costs the parent too.</strong> Fork write-protects the parent's pages and flushes its TLB entries (with shootdowns on every core running its threads). Afterward, the parent takes a write fault on the first store to each page, even when the child has already exited.</li>
<li><strong>Huge pages make copy-on-write coarse.</strong> With 2 MiB pages, a single byte written copies 2 MiB. Redis tells users to disable transparent huge pages for this reason: its snapshot forks the server, and scattered writes during the snapshot can copy almost the whole heap.</li>
<li><strong>For a simulator:</strong> user-level traces and most syscall-emulation simulators miss fault handling entirely, so first-touch and copy-on-write costs disappear from the model. A workload that forks, or allocates and touches memory in its measured region, needs full-system simulation or a correction for the kernel time.</li>

  body: `
<p><a href="#/demand-paging">Demand Paging and Copy-on-Write</a> showed that every region of an address space is a lazily faulted view of some backing object. <code>mmap</code> lets a program create such regions itself: map a file and read it with plain loads, share memory with another process, or get fresh zeroed memory. A small family of calls then changes or removes them. Main sources: Bryant and O’Hallaron’s <em>Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective</em> (sections 9.8 and 9.9), Chris Kanich’s CS 361 lecture on memory mapping, and the Linux man pages for <code>mmap</code>, <code>madvise</code>, and <code>mallopt</code>.</p>

<h3 id="sec-mmap">Mapping a File with mmap</h3>
<p><code>mmap(addr, length, prot, flags, fd, offset)</code> asks the kernel to create a region whose pages are backed by <code>fd</code> starting at <code>offset</code>. Passing <code>NULL</code> for <code>addr</code> lets the kernel pick the address. After that one call, byte <em>k</em> of the file is just address <em>base</em> + <em>k</em>, and reading or writing it is an ordinary load or store.</p>
<pre><code>/* read(): one system call and one copy per buffer */
char buf[65536];
while ((n = read(fd, buf, sizeof buf)) &gt; 0)
    sum += checksum(buf, n);

/* mmap(): one system call, then plain loads */
struct stat st;
fstat(fd, &amp;st);
const char *p = mmap(NULL, st.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
close(fd);                       /* the mapping keeps the file open */
sum = checksum(p, st.st_size);   /* first touch of each page faults it in */
munmap((void *)p, st.st_size);</code></pre>
<p>What changes compared with <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>lseek</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No system call per access.</strong> Each <code>read</code> crosses into the kernel and back. With many small reads, such as random lookups into an index, those crossings dominate. With <code>mmap</code>, a page that is already mapped costs only a load.</li>
<li><strong>No extra copy.</strong> <code>read</code> copies from the page cache into the user buffer. A mapping points the page table at the page-cache frame itself.</li>
<li><strong>The program tracks its own position.</strong> There is no file offset. Random access is just pointer arithmetic.</li>
<li><strong>The cost moves to page faults.</strong> Each first touch of a page is a fault, and errors arrive as signals (<code>SIGBUS</code> if the file shrinks under the mapping) rather than return codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The executable loader uses exactly this mechanism to map ELF segments (see <a href="#/comp-load">Loading and Running</a>), and <code>malloc</code> uses anonymous <code>mmap</code> for large blocks.</p>

<h3 id="sec-flags">Shared and Private Mappings</h3>
<p>The <code>flags</code> argument decides who sees writes:</p>
<div class="tbl"><table>
<tr><th></th><th><code>MAP_SHARED</code></th><th><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code></th></tr>
<tr><td>File-backed</td><td>Writes go to the page-cache page, are seen by every process mapping the file, and reach the file on writeback or <code>msync</code></td><td>Copy-on-write: reads see the file, the first write to a page makes a private copy, and writes never reach the file</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anonymous (<code>MAP_ANONYMOUS</code>)</td><td>Zeroed memory that stays shared with children after <code>fork</code></td><td>Ordinary private memory (large <code>malloc</code> blocks, thread stacks)</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>A <code>MAP_SHARED</code> region set up before <code>fork</code> stays one set of frames in both processes. If the parent stores 50 to a variable there, the child's next load of it sees 50. It is the cheapest form of interprocess communication, but it is a raw bulletin board: nothing notifies the other process that something changed, so real use needs atomics, futexes, or another signal on top (see <a href="#/c11-ordering">C11 Memory Ordering</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sec-change">Changing and Removing Mappings</h3>
<p>Each call below edits both the OS's list of regions and the page table. The page-table edits cost the most, because a stale translation may sit in any core's TLB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>munmap(addr, len)</code></strong> removes the range. Private pages are freed, and dirty pages of a shared file mapping stay in the page cache for writeback. Every core that may hold a translation for the range must drop it, so the kernel sends an inter-processor interrupt to each core running a thread of the process and waits until all of them have flushed. This is a <strong>TLB shootdown</strong>.</li>
<li><strong><code>mprotect(addr, len, prot)</code></strong> changes permissions, for example to make a JIT's freshly written code executable and no longer writable. Removing a permission needs a shootdown before the call returns, or another core could keep writing through a stale writable entry.</li>
<li><strong><code>madvise(addr, len, advice)</code></strong> gives hints. <code>MADV_WILLNEED</code> starts readahead, and <code>MADV_SEQUENTIAL</code> and <code>MADV_RANDOM</code> tune it. <code>MADV_DONTNEED</code> drops the pages but keeps the region, so the next touch of a private anonymous page faults in a fresh zeroed one. Allocators use it, or the lazier <code>MADV_FREE</code>, to give memory back without unmapping.</li>
<li><strong><code>msync(addr, len, MS_SYNC)</code></strong> writes a shared file mapping's dirty pages to storage and waits. It is the mapping counterpart of <code>fsync</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-malloc">Where malloc Gets Its Memory</h3>
<p><code>malloc</code> is a library function, not a system call. It carves blocks out of memory it gets from the kernel in large pieces, through one of two calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>brk</code></strong> moves the end of the heap, a single anonymous region that starts a random offset past <code>.bss</code>. glibc serves small blocks from it and reuses freed ones without asking the kernel again. It can only shrink the heap from the top.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous <code>mmap</code></strong> gives each large block a region of its own. In glibc, that means requests of at least <code>M_MMAP_THRESHOLD</code>, 128 KiB by default. <code>free</code> on such a block calls <code>munmap</code>, so the memory goes straight back to the kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>glibc raises the threshold by itself when a program frees an mmap-backed block (up to 32 MiB on 64-bit systems), so a program that keeps allocating and freeing one large size soon gets it from the heap instead. Setting the threshold with <code>mallopt</code> turns that adjustment off. Allocators such as jemalloc, tcmalloc, and mimalloc map memory in large chunks and hand it back with <code>madvise</code>, in batches, which avoids most of these calls.</p>

<h3 id="sec-perf">Performance Trade-Offs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>mmap is not always faster than read.</strong> For large sequential scans, <code>read</code> with a big buffer pays few system calls, and its copy is cheap compared with per-page faults, TLB misses, and TLB shootdowns when mappings change.</li>
<li><strong>Batch the faults.</strong> <code>MAP_POPULATE</code> faults in the whole range during the <code>mmap</code> call, <code>madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)</code> reads ahead, and the kernel's fault-around maps up to 16 already-cached file pages per fault. Each turns many small faults into one larger piece of work.</li>
<li><strong>Unmapping is expensive in threaded programs.</strong> A shootdown interrupts every core running the process, and each costs on the order of microseconds. Allocators that cache freed memory instead of unmapping it, and kernels that batch invalidations, exist largely to avoid this.</li>
<li><strong>Database systems mostly avoid mmap for their buffer pool.</strong> Crotty, Leis, and Pavlo (CIDR 2022) list the reasons: the kernel decides when pages are evicted and written back, I/O errors arrive as signals, page-table contention and shootdowns limit scaling, and the kernel may write a dirty page back at any moment, even before the transaction that changed it commits.</li>

<h3 id="sec-privilege-levels">Privilege Levels</h3>
<p>x86 has rings 0–3 (kernel in 0, user in 3). ARM has exception levels EL0 (user), EL1 (kernel), EL2 (hypervisor), and EL3 (secure monitor). RISC-V has user, supervisor, and machine modes.</p>
<h3 id="sec-hardware-sequence">The Hardware Sequence</h3>
<ol><li>Record the cause and the PC to resume at (and the faulting address, if any).</li><li>Raise privilege and switch to the kernel stack.</li><li>Jump to the handler through a vector table (x86 IDT, ARM VBAR, RISC-V stvec/mtvec).</li><li>The handler runs, then a return instruction (<code>iret</code>/<code>sysret</code>, <code>eret</code>, <code>sret</code>/<code>mret</code>) restores state.</li></ol>
<h3 id="sec-system-calls">System Calls</h3>
<p>User code puts a call number and arguments in registers and executes <code>syscall</code> (x86-64), <code>svc</code> (ARM), or <code>ecall</code> (RISC-V). The kernel dispatches through a table, does the work, and returns. A bare call costs on the order of 100 ns; the real cost includes cache and TLB pollution from kernel code.</p>
<h3 id="sec-out-order-core">In an Out-of-Order Core</h3>
<p>Exceptions are precise: they are recorded in the ROB and taken only at commit. Interrupts are taken between committed instructions, typically by flushing the pipeline. See <a href="#/rob">Reorder buffer</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec-performance-trade-offs">Performance Trade-Offs</h3>
<ul><li>Each kernel crossing flushes the pipeline and pollutes caches, branch predictors, and TLBs; frequent crossings hurt user-code IPC afterward.</li><li>Interrupt coalescing and polling trade latency for throughput in I/O-heavy servers.</li><li>Security mitigations (page-table isolation, predictor flushes) add cost at every crossing.</li></ul>`,

The load is marked faulting in its ROB entry; nothing architectural happens yet.</li><li>If an older branch was mispredicted, the load is squashed and the fault disappears.</li><li>When the load reaches the ROB head, the core flushes it and everything younger, saves the faulting PC and address (CR2 on x86, FAR on ARM), switches to kernel mode, and jumps to the fault vector.</li><li>The handler maps the page and returns; the load re-executes from the saved PC.</li></ol>`

        q: `<p>Why did system calls get more expensive after Meltdown?</p>`,
        a: `<p>Meltdown let user code speculatively read kernel memory mapped in the same address space. The fix, kernel page-table isolation, gives the kernel a separate page table, so every system call and interrupt switches page tables (and without PCIDs, flushes the TLB). That adds hundreds of cycles to each entry and exit; newer cores fix the hardware flaw so the isolation can be dropped.</p>`
